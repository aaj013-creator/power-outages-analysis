    <h1>Power Outage Duration Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Dataset Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Our dataset contains detailed information on power outages across different U.S. states, 
        with each row representing a single outage event. These events include when the outage began, 
        how long it lasted, how many customers were affected, and what factors contributed to the disruption. 
        Understanding this dataset is important because power outages are becoming increasingly common due to 
        aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and rising energy demands. By examining outage patterns, 
        we can better understand which factors contribute most to disruptions and potentially identify 
        ways to reduce their impact on communities.
    </p>

    <p>
        The central question guiding this project is: <strong>Which factors are most strongly associated 
        with longer power outage durations?</strong> This question matters because outage duration directly 
        affects public safety, economic loss, and community resilience. If we can understand what drives long outages, 
        decision-makers can better prepare and respond to emergencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dataset contains <strong>1534 rows</strong>. The relevant columns for this question are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.START</strong> — The start date and time of the outage event.</li>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.DURATION</strong> — The length of the outage in minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED</strong> — Estimated number of customers impacted.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.CATEGORY</strong> — High-level category describing the primary cause of the outage.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.SUBCATEGORY</strong> — More specific details about the cause.</li>
        <li><strong>CLIMATE.REGION</strong> — The assigned climate region for the state in which the outage occurred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quantitative Overview</h2>
    <p>
        To begin understanding our dataset, we first look at basic summary statistics about outage 
        duration and the key variables associated with it. Outage durations range widely, from very brief 
        disruptions lasting only a few minutes to extended outages lasting several days. This variation suggests 
        that different types of outages may have fundamentally different underlying causes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The climate region column shows that outages occur across all major U.S. climate areas, which means 
        environmental conditions may play a role in how long outages last. Additionally, some cause categories — 
        such as severe weather or equipment failure — appear more frequently than others, suggesting that certain 
        causes might be more associated with prolonged disruptions.
    </p>

    <p>
        These initial observations help motivate deeper analysis into which factors are truly connected to 
        longer outage durations.
